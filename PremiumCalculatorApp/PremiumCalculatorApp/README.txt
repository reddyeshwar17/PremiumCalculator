Assumptions:

1. I assume that submit button is not required as mentioned in notes 
   point-3 ( change in the occupation dropdown should trigger the premium calculation)
2. You have not mentioned, where to store the calculated premium. I assume displaying alert is enough
3. You have not mentioned either Need to create tables to store occupation,rating and factor.
   Created some enums and constants
4. I assume client side validation is not enough. Added server side validation
5. Created Test project and few test cases for Cleaner and Doctor occupation
